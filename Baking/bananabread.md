#### Ingredients
- 4 ripe bananas, cut into chunks
- 330g cups light brown sugar
- 115g cup butter, softened
- 65g chopped walnuts or pecans
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 60mls whole milk
- 272g all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt

#### Method
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
- Place the bananas into a large plastic zipper bag, seal the bag, and smoosh the bananas with your fingers until very well mashed. Set the bananas aside.
- Place the brown sugar and butter into a mixing bowl, and mix on medium speed with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.
- Cut a corner from the plastic bag, and squeeze the mashed bananas into the bowl of brown sugar mixture
- With the electric mixer on medium speed, beat in the bananas, egg, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and milk until the mixture is well combined
- Switch the mixer to low speed, and gradually beat in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and kosher salt just until the batter is smooth, about 1 minute
- Mix in the chopped nuts
- Spread the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
- Bake in the preheated oven until the bread is set and lightly browned on top, about 40 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the centre of the loaf should come out clean.
