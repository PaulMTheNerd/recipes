# Mince and Dumplings
#### Ingredients

**For the mince**
- 1 tbsp sunflower oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 2 celery sticks, finely sliced
- 2 medium carrots, diced
- 500g beef mince
- 1 can chopped tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato purée
- 350ml water
- 150ml red wine
- 1 bay leaf
- salt and freshly ground black pepper

**For the dumplings**
- 250g self-raising flour, plus extra for rolling
- 125g shredded beef suet
- ½ tsp fine sea salt
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley

#### Method
- Heat the oil in a large saucepan and cook the onion, garlic, celery, and carrots for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft.
- Add the mince and cook for a further five minutes.
- Add the tomatoes, tomato purée, water, red wine, and bay leaf.
- Add a good pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper.
- Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer gently for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.

- For the dumplings, put the flour in a bowl and stir in the suet, salt and parsley.
- Make a well in the centre and add enough cold water - you’ll need around 200ml - to mix to a soft, spongy dough.
- Use lightly floured hands to roll into small balls.
- Place the dumplings carefully on top of the mince.
- Cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook over medium heat for 20 minutes, or until the dumplings are cooked through and well risen.
